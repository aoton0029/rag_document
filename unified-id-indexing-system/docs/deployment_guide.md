# Deployment Guide for Unified ID Indexing System

## Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive guide for deploying the Unified ID Indexing System. It covers the prerequisites, deployment steps, and post-deployment verification to ensure the system is running smoothly.

## Prerequisites
Before deploying the Unified ID Indexing System, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Python 3.8 or higher
   - Virtual environment (recommended)
   - Required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

2. **Database Setup**
   - MongoDB
   - Neo4j
   - Redis
   - Milvus

3. **Docker (optional)**
   - Docker and Docker Compose installed if you plan to use containerization.

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the repository from the version control system (e.g., GitHub).

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd unified-id-indexing-system
```

### Step 2: Set Up the Virtual Environment
Create and activate a virtual environment.

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies using pip.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` provided in the root directory. Update the variables with your database connection details.

### Step 5: Set Up Databases
Run the setup script to initialize the databases.

```bash
python scripts/setup_databases.py
```

### Step 6: Run Migrations (if applicable)
If there are any migrations to be applied, run the migration script.

```bash
python scripts/migrate_data.py
```

### Step 7: Start the Application
You can start the application using the provided Docker configurations or directly through Python.

#### Using Docker
If you are using Docker, run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

#### Directly with Python
Alternatively, you can run the application directly:

```bash
python -m src.api.routes
```

### Step 8: Verify the Deployment
After starting the application, verify that it is running correctly by accessing the API endpoints or checking the logs for any errors.

## Post-Deployment
1. **Monitoring**
   - Ensure that the monitoring services are running to track the health and performance of the application.

2. **Backup**
   - Set up a backup strategy for the databases to prevent data loss.

3. **Documentation**
   - Refer to the API reference and architecture documents for further details on using the system.

## Conclusion
Following this deployment guide will help you set up the Unified ID Indexing System effectively. Ensure to monitor the application and perform regular maintenance for optimal performance.
